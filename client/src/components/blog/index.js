        <p>I like music a lot, and not just listening to it. I've got a music blog (that also hosts my writings) where I review and share music.
        For now, my blog is hosted on Wordpress. I'll be migrating it to my own site sometime in the future, maybe. Check it out <a href="http://teamzxcv.com">here.</a></p>
