        <p>I like music a lot, and not just listening to it. I've got a blog where I primarily review and share music. In addition to music, this site also hosts my creative writing, as well as
        various culture and tech related opinion pieces. For now, my blog is hosted on Wordpress. I'll be migrating it to my own site sometime in the future, maybe. Check it out <a href="http://teamzxcv.com">here.</a></p>
